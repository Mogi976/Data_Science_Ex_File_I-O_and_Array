# Data_Science_Ex_File_I-O_and_Array

This assignment covers basic Python operations with strings, arrays, and file input/output using NumPy. It includes hands-on practice with string methods, salary projection calculations, and reading/writing both single- and multi-column data files.

assignment instruction 
Create a new string b that is a but all in uppercase.
Is a changed when you create b?

How would you test to see whether b is in uppercase? That is, how could you return a boolean that is True or False depending on whether b is uppercase?

How would you calculate the number of occurrences of the letter "n" in a?

Writing and reading a single column of data: You land a job where your starting salary is $3,000 per month. Every year, at the beginning of your next year at the company, your salary increases by 3%. Do the following tasks and include them as part of your online submission for this ICA:
Calculate your monthly salary over the next 10 years. Print out your total salary. Do not factor in the time value of money (i.e., ignore the discount rate).

Write the array of values out to a file, one month on one line. Call the file moly_salary_one_col.txt.

Read the file back into another array. Use allclose to test that what you read-in is close to what you wrote out and print the results of that check to screen.  (L Try This! 9-9 describes allclose.)

Writing and reading a multi-column file of data: Do the "Writing and Reading a Single Column of Data" problem above but on each line write out the month number on the job and then the salary. Separate the two values by a tab character. After you read in your input file, compare that both the month number and salary values are the same. (You do not have to submit anything to the ICA for this question.)

Write a question that tests whether someone understands how to read in a two column file of text data into a 2-D array, where the first line of the file is a header describing the contents of the columns, and then create an array that is the sum of the two columns of the 2-D array using array syntax.  Exchange your question with another group's and answer their question. Submit your question and the solution to the other group's question. (You do not have to submit anything to the ICA for this question.)

Write a question that tests whether someone understands how to read in a four column file of text data into a 2-D array and then add up all the rows in the 2-D array (so the final result is a four-element, 1-D array).  Exchange your question with another group's and answer their question. Submit your question and the solution to the other group's question. (You do not have to submit anything to the ICA for this question.)
